# Introduction 🎉

Welcome to the R workshop! This session is like starting a game with a new champion—you might be unfamiliar at first, but you'll master it soon! 🏆 Let’s dive into the fundamentals of R programming. 🏊‍♂️

## Variables 📦

### What are Variables? 🤔

Think of variables as storage boxes where you can keep your items (data). For example:

-   **Numeric box**: Keeps numbers (like 5 or 3.14)
-   **Character box**: Stores text (like "hello")
-   **Logical box**: True/False values

📌 **Example:** `x = 5` stores the number 5 in a variable called `x`.

### How to Create Variables? ✍️

```{r}
# Assigning values to variables
x <- 10   # A numeric value
name <- "John"   # A character value
is_student <- TRUE  # A logical value
```

### Checking Variable Types 🕵️

Use the `class()` function to figure out what type of data a variable is holding:

```{r}
class(x)          # "numeric"
class(name)       # "character"
class(is_student) # "logical"
```

## Vectors 🎯

Vectors are like playlists—they hold multiple items of the same type. 📜 For example:

-   A playlist of songs (character values)
-   A list of high scores (numeric values)

### Creating a Vector 🛠️

Use `c()` to combine values into a vector:

```{r}
# A numeric vector
scores <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)

# A character vector
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")

# A logical vector
truths <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

### Accessing Vector Elements 🔍

Just like you pick a specific song from your playlist:

```{r}
scores[1]  # Gets the first element (10)
scores[2:3]  # Gets the second and third elements (20, 30)
```

### Vector Operations ✨

R lets you apply operations to all elements in one go (mass spells, anyone?):

```{r}
scores + 10  # Adds 10 to each score
scores * 2   # Doubles each score
```

## Functions 🛠️

### What are Functions? 📚

Functions are like special abilities—you invoke them to perform a task! 🪄 For example:

-   `sum()` adds up numbers.
-   `mean()` calculates the average.

### Using Functions 👩‍🔬

```{r}
# Summing a vector
total <- sum(scores)  # Output: 100

# Calculating mean
average <- mean(scores)  # Output: 25
```

### Writing Your Own Function ✍️

Make your own spells (functions):

```{r}
# A function to square a number
square <- function(x) {
  return(x * x)
}

square(4)  # Output: 16
```

## Data Frames 🗂️

Think of data frames as spreadsheets—they organize data into rows and columns. ✨

### Creating a Data Frame 📋

```{r}
# Creating a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Score = c(85, 92, 78),
  Passed = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
)

print(data)
```

### Accessing Data 🔑

```{r}
data$Score      # Access the 'Score' column
data[1, ]       # Access the first row
data[ ,2]       # Access the second column
```

## Wrapping Up 🎁

You're now equipped with the basics of R programming! 🎉 Keep practicing, and soon you'll feel like a pro adventurer navigating data with ease. 🚀

### Pro Tips 🌟

-   **Help is Your Friend**: Use `?function_name` for help (e.g., `?sum`).
-   **Explore More**: Libraries like `tidyverse` open up powerful tools for data manipulation.

Good luck, summoners! 🏆
